================================================
     Microsoft Bing TTS script for Asterisk
================================================

This script makes use of Microsoft Bing text to speech API
in order to redner text to speech and play it back to the user.
It supports a variety of different languages.

------------
Requirements
------------
Perl         The Perl Programming Language
perl-libwww  The World-Wide Web library for Perl
perl-Crypt-SSLeay or perl-IO-Socket-SSL for use of SSL/TLS encryption
Internet access in order to contact MS and get the voice data.

------------
Installation
------------
To install copy mstts.agi to your agi-bin directory.
Usually this is /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/
To make sure check your /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf file

-----
Usage
-----
agi(mstts.agi,"text",[language],[intkey],[gender]): This will invoke the Bing TTS
engine, render the text string to speech and play it back to the user.
If 'intkey' is set the script will wait for user input. Any given interrupt keys will
cause the playback to immediately terminate and the dialplan to proceed to the
matching extension (this is mainly for use in IVR, see README for examples).

The script contacts MS TTS service in order to get the voice data
which then stores in a local cache (by default /tmp/) for future use.
Parameters like default language, enabling or disabling caching and cache dir
can be set up by editing the script.

Examples
--------
sample dialplan code for your extensions.conf

;MSTTS Demo
;PLayback messages to user

exten => 1234,1,Answer()
    ;;Play mesage in English:
exten => 1234,n,agi(mstts.agi,"This is a simple microsoft text to speech test in english.",en-US)
    ;;Play message in Spanish with a femanle voice:
exten => 1234,n,agi(mstts.agi,"Esta es una simple prueba en español.",es-ES,,f)
    ;;Play message in Japanese with a male voice:
exten => 1234,n,agi(mstts.agi,"これは、日本の簡単なテストです。良い一日を。",ja-JP,,m)

;A simple dynamic IVR using MSTTS

[my_ivr]
exten => s,1,Answer()
exten => s,n,Set(TIMEOUT(digit)=5)
exten => s,n,agi(mstts.agi,"Welcome to my small interactive voice response menu.",en-US)
    ;;Wait for digit:
exten => s,n(start),agi(mstts.agi,"Please dial a digit.",en-US,any)
exten => s,n,WaitExten()

    ;;PLayback the name of the digit and wait for another one:
exten => _X,1,agi(mstts.agi,"You just pressed ${EXTEN}. Try another one please.",en-US,any)
exten => _X,n,WaitExten()

exten => i,1,agi(mstts.agi,"Invalid extension.",en-US)
exten => i,n,goto(s,start)

exten => t,1,agi(mstts.agi,"Request timed out.",en-US)
exten => t,n,goto(s,start)

exten => h,1,Hangup()

Security Considerations
-----------------------
This script contacts MS servers in order to get speech data.
The script uses TLS to encrypt all the traffic between your pbx and MS servers
so no 3rd party can eavesdrop your communication.

------------
Tiny version
------------
The '-tiny' suffixed scripts use the HTTP::Tiny perl module instead of LWP::UserAgent.
This makes them a lot faster when run in small embedded systems or boards like
the Raspberry pi. They can be used as an in-place replacement of the normal versions
of the TTS scripts and expose the same interface/cli args. To use them just make sure
you have HTTP::Tiny installed.
In debian or ubuntu based distros: 'apt-get install libhttp-tiny-perl'
In distros that don't have it in their repos: 'cpan HTTP::Tiny'
