=============================================
      Microsoft TTS script for Asterisk
=============================================

This script makes use of Microsoft Translator text to speech service
in order to redner text to speech and play it back to the user.
It supports a variety of different languages.

------------
Requirements
------------
Perl         The Perl Programming Language
perl-libwww  The World-Wide Web library for Perl
sox          Sound eXchange, sound processing program
Internet access in order to contact MS and get the voice data.

To use this script you have to subscribe to the Microsoft Translator API on Azure Marketplace:
https://datamarket.azure.com/developer/applications/

Existing API Keys from http://www.bing.com/developers/appids.aspx
still work but they are considered deprecated and this method is no longer supported.

------------
Installation
------------
To install copy mstts.agi to your agi-bin directory.
Usually this is /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/
To make sure check your /etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf file

-----
Usage
-----
agi(mstts.agi,text,[language],[intkey]): This will invoke the MS Translator TTS engine,
render the text string to speech and play it back to the user. If 'intkey' is set
the script will wait for user input. Any given interrupt keys will cause the playback
to immediately terminate and the dialplan to proceed to the matching extension (for use in IVR).

The script contacts MS TTS service in order to get the voice data
which then stores in a local cache (by default /tmp/) for future use.
Parameters like default language, enabling or disabling caching and cache dir
can be set up by editing the script.
